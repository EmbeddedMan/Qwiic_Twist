  Qwiic Twist is an I2C based rotary encoder that tracks how much the dial has been turned.
  It also offers RGB control of the illumination of the encoder (on applicable models).

  For example, if you Wire.request(0x3F, 2) you'll get two bytes from Qwiic Twist and they might read:
  byte 0: 0x01 - The MSB of a 16-bit signed integer
  byte 1: 0x5A - The LSB of a 16-bit signed integer

  0x015A = 346 so the rotary dial has been turned 346 'ticks' since power on

  To install support for ATtiny84 in Arduino IDE: https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore/blob/master/Installation.md
  This core is installed from the Board Manager menu
  This core has built in support for I2C S/M and serial
  If you have Dave Mellis' ATtiny installed you may need to remove it from \Users\xx\AppData\Local\Arduino15\Packages

  To support 400kHz I2C communication reliably ATtiny84 needs to run at 8MHz. This requires user to
  click on 'Burn Bootloader' before code is loaded.

  We don't track which reason the interrupt pin was set and which feature the user has read

  This RGB encoder has a 24 indent for one rotation.
  Each indent causes four change interrupts to fire so we divide count by four.
